0,5,"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories.",50 + years ago...
1,1,"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.",Boring! Boring! Boring!
2,5,"I just had to edit this review. This book is an (I believe I got this right) an updated re-write. Thank god I didn't get the first version. It has moved into MY top 5 favorite. He (BECHETT DeSAXBY) is also in my top 5 Hero/daydream inducing gents.Didn't expect to like it. Seemed a little too debauched. ha ha ha. I freggin loved it. Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens. The first scene AFTER he gets her back inside the castle walls...well....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm.She is tricked into delivering some refreshments to his bedroom..and she walks in on a REAL TREAT! CRIPES MY OWN HEART RATE JUST PICKED UP,HONESTLY! For the faint of heart, she walks in on a Mfff, Ah-hem (can't breath)...she's stuck on stupid..I'm not! I must have read this scene 100 times and it still hasn't gotton old. I can just see his face when he turns around...luv,luv,luved it! So there's my re-wright. I've re-read this 3x's. I've only done that with 3 other books. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS ONE. And for those of you whe know me from the other Amazon sites know I'm no shrinkin violet.So those of you who read the 1st version..throw it out..try this! YES YES YES this is a keeper,a heat inducer, and in MY top 5. (Now let's see where did I put my new toy?",Wiggleliscious/new toy ready/!!
3,5,"I don't normally buy 'mystery' novels because I just don't like them.  However, this time I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did.I found the story engrossing, the characters engaging, and it was well written.  I will buy more books from this author in this series.I still do not especially care for 'mystery' novels - I consider this book series an exception.",Very good read.
4,5,"This isn't the kind of book I normally read, although I try not to limit myself to certain genres. Sometimes I find epic fantasies a little tedious. Not so with this one! There wasn't one paragraph in this story that didn't hold my interest. Ty Johnston has a wonderful way with words so that his scenes come alive for the reader. I'm definitely buying books two and three of this trilogy!",Great Story!
5,4,"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.","When an Alien Scientist Gets Lost in the Oregon Wilderness And a Human Scientist Finds Her, Love Is Their Discovery"
6,3,"I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across. Unfortunately, I wanted more story. If the book was longer to compensate for all the bedroom activity it would be a much better read. Both the Confederate Colonel and the Southern widow were good characters and relatable, but were only written at a surface level because not enough time was given to development. At least the readers were given memories from their past to help fill in some of the blanks. And the epilogue detracted from the story in my opinion.I like Debra Glass, but this wasn't my favorite read.",Hot Civil War Read... I wanted more Romance
7,5,This was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end. The story line was full of details and kept me involved and entertained. I loved the characters and their quirks. The story was smoothly written . Secret agents and art. Who would have believed how much fun and add a twist of fate and  love.I will read this author again.Enjoy this book you won't be disappointed.,Wow and wonderful read with a twist
8,4,"If the first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading.The plotline of this book has Maggie plunged headfirst into yet another murder mystery in her hometown. When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5",Steadily getting better!
9,1,"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.",Childish writing
10,4,"I read mixed reviews on Kiss and Kin But I love Kinsey Holley so I decided I need to make my own opinion and I'm very happy I did :)In this novella Bk. 1 of Werewolves in Love Series she introduces us to Taran and Lark (gotta love the names) who by chance happen to be cousins through marriage not blood. Both these tortured individuals happen to be in love with each other but don't know what to do about for several reasons. I love the Taboo story line :)Lark gets herself into a bad position,GHB and an attempt on her life. When Taran comes to the rescue things progress and wow do they!When you read this story you feel intensity of their feelings towards each other and the struggle they both go through.I love how Kinsey portrays Lark, she is a strong character but falls apart when unsure of herself and Taran. This made her more real to me. And Taran WOW! a patient caring Alpha in cowboy boots :) Yummy.Can't wait to find out what happens next in Yours, Mine, and Howls.Check it out!! Kinsey W. Holley writes - hot, sexy, and shifter if you like that, you'll love this. xoxo",Kiss... Kiss... Kiss :)
11,1,"The only thing that got me to the end of this story was sheer cussedness.  The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.  I found myself increasingly disgusted with the female lead and her whining.  In no way did I find myself sympathetic to the protagonist nor did I find myself even caring what made him who he was.  There was no back story to explain what brought the main characters to this point of the book.  And while I can suspend my belief with the best of them, I just wasn't buying it this time.",I'm being kind with 1 star
12,5,Love the paper. Great writers but cancelled my subscription due to the price. If the price comes down to like $12/mo I might buy it them. I do buy an occasional single issue for $.99 which I really like. Gave 5 stars for the papers content. I can't rate low due to the cost since I was aware of the cost when subscribing.,Great Paper but would like a lower price
13,5,Book moved rapidly. Ending was predictiblebut I really liked. The writer held your interest all the way through. Would recommend it,II Liked It
14,2,"This is not a good ghost story, nor is it a romance. To me it was a poorly written Harlequin romance with a lot of smut thrown in.  The author doesn't appear to know what genre` she's trying to capture.There were numerous typos which I found annoying. The author also incorporated Elvis' name, but did it in a way that I found disrespectful as well as inaccurate. Stephen King she's NOT!If you're looking for a good ghost story, this isn't it. If you're looking for a romance novel, this isn't that either.It had the potential to be an interesting story, but instead turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas.I won't be looking for any other books from this author.",Lousy Read
