0,5,"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories.",50 + years ago...
1,1,"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.",Boring! Boring! Boring!
2,5,"I just had to edit this review. This book is an (I believe I got this right) an updated re-write. Thank god I didn't get the first version. It has moved into MY top 5 favorite. He (BECHETT DeSAXBY) is also in my top 5 Hero/daydream inducing gents.Didn't expect to like it. Seemed a little too debauched. ha ha ha. I freggin loved it. Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens. The first scene AFTER he gets her back inside the castle walls...well....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm.She is tricked into delivering some refreshments to his bedroom..and she walks in on a REAL TREAT! CRIPES MY OWN HEART RATE JUST PICKED UP,HONESTLY! For the faint of heart, she walks in on a Mfff, Ah-hem (can't breath)...she's stuck on stupid..I'm not! I must have read this scene 100 times and it still hasn't gotton old. I can just see his face when he turns around...luv,luv,luved it! So there's my re-wright. I've re-read this 3x's. I've only done that with 3 other books. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS ONE. And for those of you whe know me from the other Amazon sites know I'm no shrinkin violet.So those of you who read the 1st version..throw it out..try this! YES YES YES this is a keeper,a heat inducer, and in MY top 5. (Now let's see where did I put my new toy?",Wiggleliscious/new toy ready/!!
3,5,"I don't normally buy 'mystery' novels because I just don't like them.  However, this time I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did.I found the story engrossing, the characters engaging, and it was well written.  I will buy more books from this author in this series.I still do not especially care for 'mystery' novels - I consider this book series an exception.",Very good read.
4,5,"This isn't the kind of book I normally read, although I try not to limit myself to certain genres. Sometimes I find epic fantasies a little tedious. Not so with this one! There wasn't one paragraph in this story that didn't hold my interest. Ty Johnston has a wonderful way with words so that his scenes come alive for the reader. I'm definitely buying books two and three of this trilogy!",Great Story!
5,4,"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.","When an Alien Scientist Gets Lost in the Oregon Wilderness And a Human Scientist Finds Her, Love Is Their Discovery"
6,3,"I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across. Unfortunately, I wanted more story. If the book was longer to compensate for all the bedroom activity it would be a much better read. Both the Confederate Colonel and the Southern widow were good characters and relatable, but were only written at a surface level because not enough time was given to development. At least the readers were given memories from their past to help fill in some of the blanks. And the epilogue detracted from the story in my opinion.I like Debra Glass, but this wasn't my favorite read.",Hot Civil War Read... I wanted more Romance
7,5,This was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end. The story line was full of details and kept me involved and entertained. I loved the characters and their quirks. The story was smoothly written . Secret agents and art. Who would have believed how much fun and add a twist of fate and  love.I will read this author again.Enjoy this book you won't be disappointed.,Wow and wonderful read with a twist
8,4,"If the first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading.The plotline of this book has Maggie plunged headfirst into yet another murder mystery in her hometown. When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5",Steadily getting better!
9,1,"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.",Childish writing
10,4,"I read mixed reviews on Kiss and Kin But I love Kinsey Holley so I decided I need to make my own opinion and I'm very happy I did :)In this novella Bk. 1 of Werewolves in Love Series she introduces us to Taran and Lark (gotta love the names) who by chance happen to be cousins through marriage not blood. Both these tortured individuals happen to be in love with each other but don't know what to do about for several reasons. I love the Taboo story line :)Lark gets herself into a bad position,GHB and an attempt on her life. When Taran comes to the rescue things progress and wow do they!When you read this story you feel intensity of their feelings towards each other and the struggle they both go through.I love how Kinsey portrays Lark, she is a strong character but falls apart when unsure of herself and Taran. This made her more real to me. And Taran WOW! a patient caring Alpha in cowboy boots :) Yummy.Can't wait to find out what happens next in Yours, Mine, and Howls.Check it out!! Kinsey W.

11,1,"The only thing that got me to the end of this story was sheer cussedness.  The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.  I found myself increasingly disgusted with the female lead and her whining.  In no way did I find myself sympathetic to the protagonist nor did I find myself even caring what made him who he was.  There was no back story to explain what brought the main characters to this point of the book.  And while I can suspend my belief with the best of them, I just wasn't buying it this time.",I'm being kind with 1 star
12,5,Love the paper. Great writers but cancelled my subscription due to the price. If the price comes down to like $12/mo I might buy it them. I do buy an occasional single issue for $.99 which I really like. Gave 5 stars for the papers content.

13,5,Book moved rapidly. Ending was predictiblebut I really liked. The writer held your interest all the way through. Would recommend it,II Liked It
14,2,"This is not a good ghost story, nor is it a romance. To me it was a poorly written Harlequin romance with a lot of smut thrown in.  The author doesn't appear to know what genre` she's trying to capture.There were numerous typos which I found annoying. The author also incorporated Elvis' name, but did it in a way that I found disrespectful as well as inaccurate. Stephen King she's NOT!If you're looking for a good ghost story, this isn't it. If you're looking for a romance novel, this isn't that either.It had the potential to be an interesting story, but instead turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas.I won't be looking for any other books from this author.",Lousy Read

19,4,"When I first came across Jonny Tangerine's Toe Popper I hesitated reading it because of the cover. I just kept visualizing this lady on the cover getting blown up. I think if the cover had just shown the water and sand etc. with no people on the cover I may have felt different and bought it. JMO. My family and friends and I had a discussion on covers and if any of us had not bought a book because of the cover and some of us said "" A picture is worth a thousand words"" and it is the first thing we see when seeing a book is it's cover and it gives an impression of what the book is about. I've come across 3 Kindle story covers that I hadn't bought until I asked my family and friends if any of them have read the story's.I read this story week's ago and am just getting time to write the review. This mystery was gifted to me by a friend who thought I would like it and I am glad that he did because I thoroughly got hooked with the many twists and turns and holding my breath at certain times in this mystery.Characters FBI agent Catherine (I was thrilled to see a strong female FBI lead character) and to know the background and turmoil that Major Joel Lane was going through. These two characters were striving to find out who the culprit was and to put a stop to this madness.I am looking forward to reading more from Jonny Tangerine and I hope there will be a book #2 to this novel.I recommendToe Popperto mystery/thriller readers.",4 1/2 STARS for Toe Popper !! This mystery/thriller had me gasping at times !!
20,5,This book addresses a problem most churches ignore.  Many people leave organized religion because of the pain inflicted by the religious.  Chris Jackson addresses the problem from both sides and offers understanding and healing for the wounded.  Highly recommend this book for anyone who has been offended in church.,Such a neglected subject!
21,2,"I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write. I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.",Sammi Ever After

24,4,"Way too short.It is a good fun story. It pulls you in and keeps you reading. It's not that it was really too short, just that it was so fun, I tore through it too fast. It's well written with very few errors. What few there were did not stop the flow.",Good...but ;)
25,5,"James Somers has written another great book for all ages, proving that a book doesn't need graphic sex or vulgarity to be good!  It is a fast read, one that would be perfect for younger readers/teens with the right amount of fantasy and imagination without getting dragged out.  A young boy, who is used to being the one picked on, is knocked unconscious by bullies, in his dreams he finds he has ""powers"" beyond the normal and is thrown into a new world where he is important to those around him.  These dream friends accept him, respect him and encourage him.  A great story for anyone who has ever felt ""awkward"" in their own skin.",Another great book!
26,5,"Brody Nash has the perfect idea for the one year anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend Sidney - a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Drew.  Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.  He's a special guy who deserves a little happiness in his life and a special woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",4.5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies
27,3,"Aside from the clich&eacute;d marathon sex in this book I was left pretty confused by the ending as to what exactly I had just read. Did she dream it? Does he recognized her? I'm not really complaining because it's free and I did enjoy reading it for the most part, but there was nothing very special about it and the ""twist"" if that's what you call it at the end really just left me scratching my head.

34,4,"Apparently this is a prequel to the series.  I have read nothing of the series but bought the ""Lords of the Underworld"" bundle that has this book and the first three books.  I read a reviewer's note that said if you get the sample of this bundle that you will get the entire short story/prequel in that sample (word to the wise).  Of course that would only be helpful for people who have read the rest of the series and didn't want to buy the prequel.  For me, I just decided to delve into this series so I didn't mind getting it in the bundle.It has some pretty low reviews.  Normally I would never buy and probably wouldn't read a book or novella that has 3 stars.  I am pretty surprised it has such low reviews, but perhaps people were hoping for more from this prequel.This story is about the guardian to the gates of Hell (Geryon) and the goddess of oppression, Kadence who is in charging of maintaining the wall between the human realm and Hell.  The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.  Only the very end does it bring up Pandora's box (from what I can gather, the point of the story was to give us the background on Pandora's box, but I am not sure if Geryon or Kadence play any role in the rest of the books).I plan to read the next book, The Darkest Night next.

40,5,"You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover. The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past, a young and handsome College TA, Harlan, who has the hots for his even more handsome, a slightly older, College professor, Sawyer. The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme... the shorten the thing, this is the classical romance by the rule, with the twist of being a gay romance. So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan's superior, he has all the trouble of the case: he can't take advantage of his position, he doesn't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants, and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club, and Sawyer saw him at his workplace. So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question, but now there is the biggest problem that, even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student, the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer didn't make a move on Harlan, stopped to go to that club, and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy. Only that Harlan is not of the same idea, and as soon as he reaches his graduation day, he is also ready, willing and naked for the professor to take. Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age, he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve, and he thinks that, as soon as that problem is over, Sawyer will be all his to take. In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is, but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students, it's not the only problem for Sawyer; there is also the question of his side job, as a stripper, that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship, it's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing: he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit, or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer, he is jealous of Harlan, mainly due to his job, but he is also skittish when it's time to commit and give something real to Harlan. Where Harlan is open and maybe careless, at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan, he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella, mostly and erotic novella, with a lot of sex scenes, hot and nice, and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters, so there is not enough time to develop a lot, but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind, since she introduced some supporting characters (Harlan's brother, Rhys, and Sawyer's friend, Macon) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator.",You Can Leave Your Hat On by Lena Matthews

44,2,"Identical twin sisters Gwendolyn and Anora are complete opposites, but fierce friends nonetheless. Gwendolyn is the tomboy of the duo - even going so far as to cut her hair short and wear men's clothing, while Anora exudes a very feminine nature. As the eldest by minutes, Anora has been placed in an arranged marriage, but thankfully, it turned out to be a love match anyways. The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora. Gwendolyn continues her identity as Garric in hopes to keep Anora's virtue intact for her betrothed.Well, the one thing that attracted me to the story was the outline. As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.",Shallow characters and shallow themes...

58,2,"This is the first Star Wars novel I've read since the wonderfully adapted novelization of Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. Sadly, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice does not inspire me to continue reading expanded universe novels. While many readers find fault with the brief length of this novel, I found it to be the book's only saving grace (other than its price). Surprisingly, the characters in this novel are quite lackluster and are a far cry from the variety of Sith Lords we're accustomed to. Whereas the Sith Lords of the Star Wars films and previous EU books tend to be frightening figures, the 'humanized' Sith Lords in ""Precipice"" are poor ambassadors of the Dark Side of the Force.Perhaps this series will improve with successive books. But Precipice fails to deliver the kind of intriguing space opera that I love about Star Wars. Fortunately, Fate of the Jedi: Omen of which Precipice is only a prequel, appears to be a far more interesting read. As much as it pains me to say it, I would have a very difficult time recommending this book to anyone except the most die-hard Star Wars fan.

Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time, (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner",entertaining insightful look at the south

Most readers will enjoy the story so long as they aren't expecting something more in line with 'horror'.  The writing was done well, the characters were believeable, though not always likeable (I personally did not LIKE Izzy at all, though I could sympathize with her), and Kindle formatting was fine.

It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?

This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.  If this had been a full length novel, I am sure it would have rated higher in my opinion.

89,2,"As I read this story I felt like a fan watching a crash at a NASCAR race. I kept trying to look away but I was drawn to see just how bad it could be. As 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' was to movies, this book is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally implausible that I laughed out loud, all blended together with a bizarre world view of how people behave. I kept thinking that the author was either brilliantly satirizing and mocking survivalist thinking or he was a horrifically bad writer.

97,3,"Review contains spoilersThe premise of the story sounded great. Two men who grew up together, one gay, the other straight have to marry/bond for their clans to strike a peace. You see the guys aren't just guys they are werewolves. So, we have two great cliches in one story: 1.) forced arranged marriage and 2.) paranormal/werewolves.However, while the story has some hot chemistry between the two leads, Hayden and Josh, the overall drama is told in flashbacks, which take away from the present day tale. Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless. So I can only give the book 3 stars. The premise had promise, but did not come to full frution.",Werewolf drama

101,2,"What a basically ""blah"" story. Neither of the characters are especially interesting, the violence isn't at all effective (and of questionable reality in certain areas), there's no motivation for what's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it. We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking; one as a driver and the other as a passenger. When they meet up, it's like ""Frankenstein vs the Wolfman"", only even less interesting. I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic, but the sexual content is glossed over quickly, as per the usual for American audiences.There's some real potential here as a plot idea, but the execution, as it were, is terrible. I have no interest in reading anything by either of these authors and if I'd not downloaded the story for free, I'd feel quite ripped off.","Reads like bad internet fiction... oh, wait..."

I have loved Dickens since high school, so the story about the &#34;missing&#34; Christmas story was fascinating and Josh Lanyon did a wonderful job of weaving portions/excerpts from that (fictitious) book into his own.  I never realized what a market there is for rare books.  As usual, Lanyon's writing is flawless.  I always enjoy his style.  James' neighbor was an endearing (although sometimes annoying character) and watching James take to her, despite himself, was a sweet touch.  And the glow-in-the-dark, flavored condoms were awesome.  I do wish the story hadn't ended so abruptly; I did not have enough interaction between James and Sedgewick to fully believe in their love/HEA.",Another good holiday story from Josh Lanyon
105,2,"There were a lot of interesting characters, in fact maybe too many. The ancillary characters were given a little too much significance, causing the need to bring too many pieces into the final closure. Just as a movie wouldn't seem real without the ""extras"", neither would a good book. However, when a clerk in a convenience  store says,""May I help you?"" in a movie, the director doesn't bring the clerks history into the movie. Ms Outroggeg gives far too much background on each person introduced and it leaves you rather confused at times. It also calls for some unbelievable endings to the assorted storylines. the main story was really good, but all the clutter sort of ruined the book for me.",It's An OK Story...but...

112,3,"If I could give this story 3 1/2 stars instead of 3, I would have. This is basically a love story about a physically & mentally damaged guy who has pretty much stayed in the shadows due to his deformity. That doesn't stop him from getting what he wants - whether success in the financial world or his share of women. His main thing is not letting anyone close to him.Well...along comes Katie who has become an object of his desire and lust due to a self-portrait of her that he purchased from the coffee shop she works in. Of course she becomes his current challenge to get her into bed. However, he hasn't ever encountered someone like Katie - she meets him head on in his sexual whims and desires but she is also a pure loving soul who sees past his deformity. She's not out to get anything from him except his love. In the first half of the story, I was a little taken aback by how easily Katie fell into his sexual wishes so soon and sudden. Cain came across a bit like a stalker, lurking in the night - but it was understood that he preferred the darkness of the night so he could hide his deformity. He also came across as hot and cold and it was puzzling to Katie.Of course since he doesn't believe he is deserving of her love, he initially pushes her away with cruel and cold words. But credit has to be given to Katie - she didn't slink away or let his mean words push her away..initially. I kept thinking that if someone said those means things to me, I would have been gone in a flash. But because she didn't let his words push her away, he started to see the relationship in a different light. But of course his demons kept coming out and eventually it did accomplish in pushing her away.The second half of the story was simply a realization. It takes a true love to take you out of the darkness and into the light...but only if you can see it in yourself that you are worthy of being loved. Love isn't easy - when you find that love you have to hold on. And that's what Cain comes to realize in the end. The book started off with light BDSM and turned into a deeper story of love.",Beauty and the Beast love story
113,4,"I read this one first, when it is actually #2 in the series.  I loved it!  Rachel Myers is a character that I really like.  She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.  Her new suitor hopefully works out, as well as her new job.I intend to download as many as I can of these mysteries.  With cozy mysteries like this one, there is always something new to learn.  Cozy and mystery fans in general, go for it!",Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge is great!
114,2,"I couldn't finish this book. The main character was a poor, uneducated boy, who kept harping on an on about his 'hydrophobia' which-- in case you, like the author didn't know-- is actually the name for rabies.

115,3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence, no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But, while some of the formatting flaws add to the story, there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything.",Flawed but Beautifully Written

I really liked the story of this first book, the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series.",Out of order

Adam was very wealthy, handsome, jealous, ruthless and determined man. He also had trust issues, due to his past. He took, whatever, whomever he wanted and he wanted Alicia.

127,4,"To a certain extent, Zombie Literature has been done to death and beyond, even to the point where it has become fashionable to insert zombies into classic works like Pride and Prejudice.  This book marks a nice departure from standard zombie fare, while retaining enough of the genre to keep that nice post-apocalyptic feel that zombies are so good at providing.  While I like the single-minded focus of your average zombie, I found that the idea of a few smart zombies thrown into the mix added to the sense of peril.  It appears that most of the typos referenced in other reviews have been corrected and I thought that the book was well-written, suspenseful and even funny at times.  In addition, character development was good and I found myself looking forward to the second installment.  While by no means perfect, this is a really decent effort and fully merits 4 stars.","Actually, A Very Good Zombie Book"

I charge the Kindle every few days with my phone. I liken the concern with carrying the cord similar to that if someone was concerned with where to put the cord for their cell phone cover. I doubt you are going to need the cord with you every day. You have suitcases, purses, backpacks, cars generally someplace other than having the cord with you 24/7.

130,3,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee

(In other words - they want to see if cats & dogs CAN play well together...)  Due to his father's illness, Gionne pushes Jenna away and she is NOT understanding of this and turns her back on him.  Fast forward a few years and she is asked to be a ""guest"" at Gionne's compound while the lupines grant the felines some much needed land to hunt on.  This story has REALLY REALLY HOT sex scenes - menage & anal are some, so you are warned! - and lots of miscommunication due to some betrayals by one of the pack members.What this story doesn't have?  Descriptive communication.  At times I felt like I was reading stilted, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator style dialogue.  It was driving me nuts.  (NOT - ""It was driving me nuts!"", she exclaimed emphatically.)  Like I said, though, this is the first of the series (published in 2009) and is over 300 pages.  I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that as the author got into the series, the dialogue flowed a bit more easily.Hey - it's a free trial right now.  Doesn't hurt to try, right?  And if you really like shifter romances - this could be the start of one of your favorite series!  YAY!",FERAL DOMINATION - TERMINATOR STYLE!
152,5,The one rule of a short story is that it be short. lol.  I remember before The Wild's Call was released on kindle it was released chapter by chapter; week by week and I would anxiously wait for Monday to rush to my computer and log-on just to read it before work.It complements the trilogy perfectly.  It gives us the idea how the world was after the collapse but before the spirits completely set in.  I also loved the fast pacing and the character's growth didn't suffer at all due to the quick story flow.If you are going to read this trilogy I recommend you read this prequel as well.,It's supposed to be short.
153,1,"I read a lot of the independent authors that publish on Amazon and generally don't mind if a book is not quite what I expected but with this book I am really really sorry I wasted the .99The idea/premise of this book is not a bad one, the actual execution of the story is a whole different matter.The dialogue was childish and stilted and read more like a high school drama.

154,5,"Nicole Zoltack's WOMAN OF HONOR weaves the tale of the first lady knight of Arnhem. Sprinkled with historical facts, bullies, and a good dose of love and honor, WOMAN OF HONOR is a coming of age novel set in the fantastical medieval world of Arnhem Kingdom. Aislinn is brave and truly grows to be a woman of honor. The characters are likeable and realistic. We feel Aislinn's pains while she tries to prove herself. She overcomes tradition and the growing threat of Speica. This novel has history, knights, and mythological creatures and is filled with intrigue, mystery, horror, and, most important of all, love. In this first book of the Kingdom of Arnhem series, I feel like we touch upon their lives and a conflict looming in their future.

155,2,"This book deserves 2.5 stars. It's not the worst thing I've read, yet it wasn't the best either.The protagonist, Emily Fenwick, is a police officer who is suddenly whisked into an alternate New York set in 1890. Except it's not really an alternate New York, nor are there any scenarios that could be labeled steampunk. It's more fantasy-based with a world that I found intriguing.Emily wakes up in Steamside, a world connected to 1890's ""normal"" New York. Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads. POVs were difficult to distinguish, and the dialogue was all jumbled up. The romance was tedious and unbelievable. Have I mentioned juvenile?It was a fun read, but Steamside Chronicles just wasn't the best.",Light fun

160,2,"Day of Sacrifice: The Prophecy (Day of Sacrifice Stories #1) by S. W. Benefiel(Discloser: I received this eBook free in order to write a review)Summary:Flora is approaching her twenty first birthday.  That is normally an exciting time for a young woman, but Flora isn't normal.  She is the first born in her family and, therefore, is the family sacrifice to the Gods.  Her entire life has lead up to the day of her death.  Her sacrifice ensures the Gods blessings on her family.  Flora is a bit of a rebelled but she knows her duty.  She pushes the limits to the fullest extent but she knows what will happen on her birthday.  Her pure body (she's a virgin) will be sacrificed to the Gods.My thoughts: (Some spoilers)For a short story, this novella was packed with a lot of story.  An entire background was given for a society that contains supernatural beings (witches, werewolves, and vampires) as well as lowly humans.  Included with the background for the story, a short tale was included.  While I think that the background information was well done, I'm not sure that the characters were as well developed.  The story happened very fast and I was unclear why chances were taken.  Some of it seemed very convenient to the story.  The idea of sacrifices was clearly disliked by many characters in the story but it seems that it has gone on for quite a few years.  Such ingrained tradition doesn't get challenged on a whim.  There just wasn't enough story invested to make any kind of changes.  Clearly, I am implying that there is a challenge to the idea but I won't say any more about it.Personally, the book was too graphic with too many uses of the F word but if those things don't bother you, then you may like this book.  With all that said, I give this novella a 2 out of 5.",Too Short to really work well
161,3,"This was a quick read.  I didn't feel much of a connection between the characters, you feel like you are just jumping right into the middle of the story.

164,3,"I like the book and will read the others but the word usage and constant typos are distracting. At least someone should proof the manuscript before it gets this far. In the way distant past these people were called editors.Seriously, the errors come so often that it is actually difficult to follow the story sometimes. You find yourself looking for the next misuse of a word like ""there"" instead of the proper ""they're."" I mean this is pretty bonehead stuff and either show someone really just typing instead of writing or someone who is displaying a real lack of education. This happens pretty much every page.",Needs an editor - bigtime
165,3,"This is a short story first published in 1940 as a two part serial in the pulp fiction magazine Argosy. The author later decided to develop the characters in three novellas which have also been adapted to the Kindle. This is a very quick read, and thus since it is so inexpensive I recommend that anyone who is interested in the genre and plans to read the subsequently published books( which I rate highly) should read it first.The main character in this book is the detective Doan, and unfortunately his huge Great Dane Carstairs makes only a cameo introductory appearance.  Fortunately, in the subsequent stories Carstairs plays an integral role and adds immeasurably to the reader's enjoyment. Doan's unimpressive appearance leads his adversaries to underestimate his (and Carstairs') skill and intelligence, and in this introduction to his character the author has not yet fully developed Doan's skills. However, it is still a typical pulp fiction story concerning a hard boiled detective except for the fact that as the author developed the characters over the series he injected much more humor than was usual for that era.After an interesting introduction to the series' characters in the first few chapters, Doan is tasked to protect a young heiress about to receive her inheritance. He travels to a wilderness resort cabin, and becomes isolated there with a strange cast of characters while a blizzard rages outside. However,  murders occur, misdirection abounds, and of course he eventually untangles the web of deceit, earning his keep and rescuing a damsel in distress.. As in all short stories of this type, the prose is spare and the character development minimal. But a fast pace keeps the reader's interest.Unfortunately,  the author Norbert Davis is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the period for three reasons. First, his stories encompassed a wide array of genres, so he never built a reputation as a practitioner  of specific type (e.g. detective, SF, etc.) . Second, his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period, a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny. Third, he committed suicide at age 40, supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer. Thus, his potential literary legacy was truncated. However, among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era, including Hammett and McDonald. He graduated from Stanford with a law degree, but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college, usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word. Hopefully, the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and be delighted by Carstairs' collaborations with Doan.Also, after reading this short story you can decide if you agree with me that the author's choice of title was very clever due to the multiple images invoked.Tucker Andersen 6/4/2010",Recommended as Intro to the Series - Wonderful Character Sketches
166,1,"This is not objective research presented in a scholarly manner. The author is very narrow-minded, providing readers with nothing useful in gaining insight into the criminal mind. This is a speculative rant, nothing more. Do beliefs and emotional gratification play a part as to why people commit criminal acts? Of course they do. But this short read provides no hard evidence in support of that as I was expecting before reading this. This serves as a good example of the kind of crap that should be avoided by anyone hoping to actually contribute to the issues of crime and prevention.",A Speculative Rant - Not Objective Research

169,4,"I loved this book. Victor has one of the most fascinating voices I've met.He is not bothered by his flaws and moderately interested in what happens around him if he's not involved. Things and people almost happen to him. He is absorbed in himself and at the same time he doesn't take himself too seriously. His psychic powers are an annoyance and he would clearly get rid of them if he could. Although he's been trained to use them, it's clear he didn't pay much attention during his classes and people around him always seem to know more than him. He tries to turn down his psychic abilities popping drugs like candies, but he's never hiding himself and he doesn't seek for excuses. He is what he is.At the beginning I thought the unconscious way he attracts Jacob Marks, who is his exact opposite, elegant, smart, sexy, was impossible to understand and I felt the author owed us some sort of explanation. Now I know it's not necessary. Jacob falls for Victor like I fell for him as a reader: fast, hard, with no apparent reason.This is the first book of a great series. I give it only four stars out of frustration because it's too short!",You'll love Vic!

Some are a little too repetitive in that he reuses certain material.  At least one had virtually no ending.  Some are too predictable.  All are well written and pleasant to read, just a little dated.  I would have to say overall that I enjoy the stories in the book and would recommend it if you are tired of some of the more modern trends in writing.  With Lovecraft you have to have an imagination.  He counts on it and plays with it in order to achieve his goal of giving you the creeps.  He takes you just so far and then lets your mind do the rest.  This requires a certain talent both from the writer and the reader.  A nice collection of stories to keep your mind occupied when you need it.",You really cannot go wrong here.

173,4,"This is Jules Verne's attempt at writing a Robinson Crusoe / Swiss Family Robinson castaway story, with the twist that the five castaways crash-land a balloon and thus come to the island with almost nothing -- unlike Crusoe or the Swiss Family, the castaways here don't have a boat-full of resources, tools, etc., to fall back on, and have to make *everything* themselves, from the ground up, armed only with their knowledge of science and engineering. Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.",Verne's version of Robinson Crusoe

And she's selfish and mean. Others have commented on her narrow minded view of men, (which is true) but I found the fact that she was mean to her elderly neighbor to be an even bigger turn off.I've already wasted a couple hours reading this book, but it's not too late to save yourself.

What I cannot forgive, however, is the misuse of words in a book!!!  Writers need to do more than use spellcheck to find those--they need to actually READ THE BOOK.

Nikias, the older brother of Daryle's boyfriend, Alexis, is dead set against his little brother marrying a ""gold digger"", and also plans to put a stop to the wedding. While the young lovers hide under an alias, Diona checks into a hotel under her own name, and Nikias arranges for her to be ""invited"" to stay at his island home. Diona thinks the invitation is from her sister's boyfriend and accepts the invitation so she can talk them out of the marriage. When she arrives on the island, she's met by older brother Nikias who is convinced that Diona is the woman his brother plans to marry, and he informs her that he plans to keep her prisoner on the island until her flight home. Nikias is sure he has the right woman and no amount of arguing or reasoning on Diona's  part will convince him otherwise.Nikias is disturbed by how much he is drawn to his  brother's supposed girlfriend. He's rich, handsome and a bit of a playboy, but he's never been attracted to a woman like he is to her.  As he and Diona spend time together, he starts to wonder if maybe she's telling the truth, but he won't let himself doubt that he's right. As the mistaken identities get worked out, the broken trust remains an issue, both for Diona and Nikias and Nikias and his brother, Alexis. Until that can be mended and the breaches healed, those relationships have no chance.

Avery sends a message to Alex requiring him to assist Caitlin and to let her interview and observe police officers for a week.  Alex hates it, but he grudgingly allows it.  He takes her to lunch.  They begin to fall for each other.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I don't recommend it.  It's not nearly as good as her other books.  There are two stories going on, and both are lacking.  The first story is the relationship between Alex and Caitlin.  There is too much pondering and inaccurate assumptions.  Caitlin assumes things which are not true but cause her distress.  A major separation happens because Alex is commitment shy.  It just wasn't interesting.  The second story is about catching the crook Ratso, described below.CAUTION MINOR SPOILER:With evidence from Ratso they can put away major criminal Lopez.  The first time they catch Ratso he tells them he has to go to the bathroom, and then he escapes out a tiny window.  The second time they catch him, he tells a policeman that the cuffs are too tight and hurt.  So the policeman stupidly removes the cuffs.  Then Ratso does something bad.
