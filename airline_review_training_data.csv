@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin,0
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).,0
@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. üëéüò°‚úàÔ∏è #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm,0
@SouthwestAir Thanks Lindsey &amp; the Southwest twitter team for great service &amp; a speedy resolution #LuvAgent #swa,1
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.,0
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.,0
"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP",0
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.,0
@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?,0
"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday",0
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!,0
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.,0
".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.",0
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed,0
@SouthwestAir good to be back. See you all again in several weeks.,1
@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx,1
@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?,0
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.,0
"@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!",0
@VirginAmerica Thanks!,1
@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!,0
@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there,0
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(,0
"@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable",0

@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.,0

@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi,0
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.,0
"@USAirways I promise, if I can help it I will nvr fly w/u again. Even if I have 2 pay more $$$ 2 fly w/ sum1 else #badcustomerservice",0
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :),1
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.,0
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.,0
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.,0
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?,0
@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had,0

@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far,0
@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.,0
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.,0
"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers",0
"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)",1
"@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.",0
@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years,0
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly,0
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!,0
@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?,0
@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt,0
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.,0
"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service",0
@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!,1

@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.,1
"@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho",0
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.,0
@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.,0
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.,0
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off,0
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.,0
@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh,0
@SouthwestAir had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business,0

@united Thanks for the update.,1
@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?,0
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.,0
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.,0
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.,0
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.,0
This shits gotta stop RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/PEQ90pqMpp,0

@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.,0
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!,0
@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness,0
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.,0
@JetBlue their names are both Angel (seriously - how cool is that!). Truly FANTASTIC service!,1
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?,0
@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline,1

@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent,0
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better,0

@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues,0
"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.",0
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?,0
@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!,0
"@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes",0

@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?,0
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs,0
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.,0
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.,0

@JetBlue 290 to Boston,0
@AmericanAir from a service rep but that hasn't happened yet. I'm honestly fed up and sick of this. No notice when my flight got Cancelled Flighted,0
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome,0
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....,0
"@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?",0

"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.",0
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.,0
"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.",0
@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp; a beverage. Easy cheesy,1
@USAirways Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!!,1
"@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options?",0
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!,1
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou,0
"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?",0
@SouthwestAir please refund my ticket. What a terrible experience. #southwestfail,0
"@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.",0
@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly,0
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???,0
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for two hours and finally hung up. I was able to do what I needed to without customer service eventually.,0
"@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising.",0
Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue,0
"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.",0
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards,0
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.,0
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees,0
@SouthwestAir There's nothing I love more than being on hold for over an hour http://t.co/LIQWoblFbT,0
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.,1
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston,0

@JetBlue the best airline in the world,1
"@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!",0
@SouthwestAir Horrible experience ever with airline..Have to reconsider any future flights. Customer service ... http://t.co/EczHcmM5vi,0

@USAirways want to bump up my seet to first class for two Cancelled Flightlations in 24hrs?? what a joke,0
"@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?",0
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.,0
"@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!",0
@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX,0
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!,0
"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever.",0
"@SouthwestAir I have sent the DM, should I continue to wait on hold with a rep, or will you be servicing me here?",0
"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not",0
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf,0
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?,0
"@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!",0
@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention,0
"@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface",0
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.,0
@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?,1
"@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.",0
"@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of ""Whiplash"" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback",0
"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.",0
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup,0

"@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(",0
"@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..",0
"@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.",1
@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards,0

@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(,0
@SouthwestAir I do need help Cancelled Flighting my flight back. Your calls times are ridiculous.,0
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace,0
Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.,0
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay,0
@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.,1
@USAirways issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities,0
@SouthwestAir 3 + hrs w/out bags being returned to us after flight 2464 Cancelled Flightled. Maybe put a couple people on it?,0
"@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte",0

"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.",0
@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.,1

@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!,0
@SouthwestAir thanks!,1
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.,0
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice,0
@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again,0
"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark",0
"@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn‚Äôt a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now",0

@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-),1
"@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant",0

"@USAirways is it policy to tell customers ""We can't help you?"" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable",0
"@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board",0

@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful,0
"@SouthwestAir have you considered adding the ""we'll call you back when we have someone free"" feature to your support line?",0

"@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!",0

@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW,0

@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay,0
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta,0

"@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight this AM. There was avail flight to PHL today u said was sold out. I had to buy 2nd ticket, u need to refund me.",0

@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items,0
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!,1
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable,0
"@USAirways still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me?",0

@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!,0
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.,0
@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.),0
@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...,1
@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.,0

@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive,0
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand,0

"@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??",0

@JetBlue my flight attendant Angel was awesome. #415 #kudos,1

@SouthwestAir   Where the heck are the bags for Chicago 408. It has been an hour,0
"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability",0
@USAirways Thanks for the information!,1
@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.,0
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX,0
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???,0
@USAirways @jtrexsocial exactly! How? I've been disconnected 3 times!!!!,0
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?,0
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don‚Äôt need this much trouble.,0
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise,1
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns,0
"@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.",0
@AmericanAir. It's been 5 hours and still no call and now we are back to being hung up on by an automated system.  #AmericanAirlines,0
@USAirways your service sucks.,0
@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible,1
"@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report""",0
@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.,0
"@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :(",0
@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.,1

@SouthwestAir your employees at BWI have been amazing!,1
@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min,0
@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming,0
@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst,0
"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.",0
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly,0
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!,1

@SouthwestAir now flying non stop CMH-OAK has me daydreaming about a trip to the bay...especially in this weather. #OhioProbz,1
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn‚Äôt have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It‚Äôs a dumb delay.,0

@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.,0
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris,0
@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.,0
"@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail",0
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.,0
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other,0
"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest",0
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!,0

@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.,0
"@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago.",1
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days,0

"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?",0

@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.,1

@JetBlue Thank you Alicia!  #ExceptionalService,1
@USAirways still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes,0

@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me,0
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day,0
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.,0
@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;),1
@JetBlue loving the free #wifi and #legroom ‚úàÔ∏è #SeattleBound,1
"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?",0
"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I‚Äôve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y‚Äôall every time!",1
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.,1
"@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?",0
@USAirways No flights out of Philly because of system wide tech issue.   @CBSPhilly,0
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.,0
@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member,0
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?,0
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more,0
"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.",0
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.,1
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.,0
@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.,0
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.,0
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat,0
"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67",0
@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks,1
