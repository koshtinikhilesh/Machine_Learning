0,5,"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories.",50 + years ago...
1,1,"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.",Boring! Boring! Boring!
6,3,"I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across. Unfortunately, I wanted more story. If the book was longer to compensate for all the bedroom activity it would be a much better read. Both the Confederate Colonel and the Southern widow were good characters and relatable, but were only written at a surface level because not enough time was given to development. At least the readers were given memories from their past to help fill in some of the blanks. And the epilogue detracted from the story in my opinion.I like Debra Glass, but this wasn't my favorite read.",Hot Civil War Read... I wanted more Romance
7,5,This was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end. The story line was full of details and kept me involved and entertained. I loved the characters and their quirks. The story was smoothly written . Secret agents and art. Who would have believed how much fun and add a twist of fate and  love.I will read this author again.Enjoy this book you won't be disappointed.,Wow and wonderful read with a twist
8,4,"If the first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading.The plotline of this book has Maggie plunged headfirst into yet another murder mystery in her hometown. When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5",Steadily getting better!
9,1,"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.",Childish writing
10,4,"I read mixed reviews on Kiss and Kin But I love Kinsey Holley so I decided I need to make my own opinion and I'm very happy I did :)In this novella Bk. 1 of Werewolves in Love Series she introduces us to Taran and Lark (gotta love the names) who by chance happen to be cousins through marriage not blood. Both these tortured individuals happen to be in love with each other but don't know what to do about for several reasons. I love the Taboo story line :)Lark gets herself into a bad position,GHB and an attempt on her life. When Taran comes to the rescue things progress and wow do they!When you read this story you feel intensity of their feelings towards each other and the struggle they both go through.I love how Kinsey portrays Lark, she is a strong character but falls apart when unsure of herself and Taran. This made her more real to me. And Taran WOW! a patient caring Alpha in cowboy boots :) Yummy.Can't wait to find out what happens next in Yours, Mine, and Howls.Check it out!! Kinsey W. Holley writes - hot, sexy, and shifter if you like that, you'll love this. xoxo",Kiss... Kiss... Kiss :)
11,1,"The only thing that got me to the end of this story was sheer cussedness.  The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.  I found myself increasingly disgusted with the female lead and her whining.  In no way did I find myself sympathetic to the protagonist nor did I find myself even caring what made him who he was.  There was no back story to explain what brought the main characters to this point of the book.  And while I can suspend my belief with the best of them, I just wasn't buying it this time.",I'm being kind with 1 star
12,5,Love the paper. Great writers but cancelled my subscription due to the price. If the price comes down to like $12/mo I might buy it them. I do buy an occasional single issue for $.99 which I really like. Gave 5 stars for the papers content. I can't rate low due to the cost since I was aware of the cost when subscribing.,Great Paper but would like a lower price
13,5,Book moved rapidly. Ending was predictiblebut I really liked. The writer held your interest all the way through. Would recommend it,II Liked It
14,2,"This is not a good ghost story, nor is it a romance. To me it was a poorly written Harlequin romance with a lot of smut thrown in.  The author doesn't appear to know what genre` she's trying to capture.There were numerous typos which I found annoying. The author also incorporated Elvis' name, but did it in a way that I found disrespectful as well as inaccurate. Stephen King she's NOT!If you're looking for a good ghost story, this isn't it. If you're looking for a romance novel, this isn't that either.It had the potential to be an interesting story, but instead turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas.I won't be looking for any other books from this author.",Lousy Read
