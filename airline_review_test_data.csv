@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.,0
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou,1
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful,0
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.,0
@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?,0
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun,0
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air,1
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service,0
@VirginAmerica Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :),1
@United I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight,1
@USAirways so upset with customer service. I have a simple question and the phone system has disconnected me all day today and yesterday.,0
"@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag",0
@SouthwestAir flight #211pilot spilled his tea on the radio! Yay for delays! Almost an hour now!,0
"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!",0

@JetBlue nope. None to be found,0
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce,0
"@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed.",0
"@JetBlue Love you, bae. #JetBae",1
@SouthwestAir Gracias... appreciate that!,1
"@SouthwestAir Sent your way, thanks for the help.",1
"@AmericanAir I love the Admiral Clubs! Thanks, hey can you follow me?",1

@VirginAmerica Congrats on winning the @Travelzoo award for Best Deals from an Airline (US) http://t.co/kj1iljaebV,1
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016,1
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting,0
@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...,0
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.,0
@USAirways on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal!,0
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day,0
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it,0
@SouthwestAir 2 wounded vets stuck. Hv trouble with agent help. On hold and no answer on Twitter. Pls respond,0
"@AmericanAir plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off. Flight Cancelled Flightled, missed wedding. #badbusiness",0
@JetBlue Finally taking off! LAS-FLL-SJU #letsgo,1
@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.,0
"@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier",1
"@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP",0
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.,0
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude üò°üò°,0
@USAirways I have been trying to get through to a representative for 7 hours aboout my Cancelled Flightled flight. Have you simply given up?,0
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!,0
@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.,0
"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours",0
@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us,0
@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail,0
@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke,0
"@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.",0
@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.,0
.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.,0
"@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to ""ground handling delays affecting a prior flight.""",0
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone,0
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow,0
@SouthwestAir now our pilots timed out...#getmeoutofhere,0
@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx,1
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.,0
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.,0
@JetBlue I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail,0
"@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might ""know"" but don't show it.",0
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify,0
"@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each.",0
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.,0
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing,0
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in,1
@SouthwestAir crew on flight 206 is awesome! Tell them I sent this tweet and maybe they will give me free wifi... #canthurtasking,1
"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada",0
@VirginAmerica That's classy.,1
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt,0
"@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that",0
@SouthwestAir Thank you so much for stepping up your game and making my day after night of elevator music. Much appreciated.,1
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr,0
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.,0
"@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac",0
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm,0
@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?,0
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.,0
"@USAirways worst service at Reagan Int. I rarely post about a company or service, but I am so annoyed. Not weather reLate Flightd‚Ä¶incompetence.",0
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.,0

@Jetblue Delay = Perfect time to learn Swift programming with @TeamTreehouse,0
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.,0
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax,0

"@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board",0

@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4,0
@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline,0
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...,0
"@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable.",0
@SouthwestAir ohk. Thank You!!! B/C of the inexpensive airfares that Southwest has I can now travel around.,1
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.,0

"@AmericanAir @united You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated",0
@USAirways now on hold for 2 hrs 20 min. This is ridiculous,0
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!,0
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it,0
@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs,0

"@AmericanAir thank you, truly appreciate the help, just sent a DM",1
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating,0
@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.,0
@USAirways 799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse.,0

@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.,0
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job,1
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!,0
@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.,0
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem,0

@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.,1
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers,0
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.,0
"@USAirways I have LITERALLY been on hold since 3am est.PlatinumEventually hung up &amp; again back on hold. Understand weather, but ridiculous.",0

@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.,0

@USAirways and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away!,0

@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me,0

@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.,0

@SouthwestAir Your hold music needs 2 be fixed:certain tracks have loud phone button mashing tones in them.Estimated wait time would help 2.,0

@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.,0
