This is my third 4k TV and it blows away everything I have had previously perfect, SONY's motion processor is by far the best on the market, and android TV is unbelievably smooth on this tv (compared to an NVIDIA shield, apple tv, and firestick). Concerns about back lighting zones and haloing are extremely overblown. Yes you will see some haloing, but you will see this on every single non-oled TV. Is it as good as the top Samsung or Vizio at controlling haloing, absolutely not, but this TV blows away the competition in pretty much every other category. Concerns about lower native contrast ratio have no standing in real world viewing. Anyone who is complaining about this has not ever really watched this TV. I only have one complaint that knocks this TV from a perfect 5 star review. The reflections are much worse than described. They don't make this TV horrible or unwatchable but they are definitely a let down for such a premium product. I think this has to do with the wide angle filter, you get reflections from all over the place that would normally not be an issue. Again not the end of the world and really as long as you have some light control in your room its fine, but this is not the TV for a room with lots of large windows. Speaking of the wide angle filter it really does work well. Best viewing angles I've ever seen. To sum it all up fantastic TV, needs a little work on the viewing angles. For the price they are selling these for now there is absolutely no better deal, these won't be around much longer but while they are they are a steal.",TheBigChalupa11,0,0,Yes,No,5/20/2020,32,8,1,0,0

Just plug into any available HDMI port and the power cable into any USB port hanging around. plenty of spare ports. If you need to use the power supply you will need to use your own USB/mini USB cable because the included one probably isn't long enough. Just plug in the stuff and follow the onscreen instructions to log in to their website and continue from there. It will find your wifi network and walk you through the connection. The only downside may be that you need to use your phone as the remote. This may or may not be inconvenient depending on how you use your phone.
